### Tong Fa Project Page
This is a page that contains an installation instruction for iOS, Android and Server. If you have any questions, contact us.

### iOS Setup Instruction
Before running the project, you have to set up the environment. We are using **Cocoapods** to manage librarys for the iOS app. Open the terminal and input following command:

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

After installed Cocoapods, go to the project directory and install the librarys that we need.

```
$ cd project_root
$ pod install
```

Then everything is prepared to roll, open the `tongfa.xcwordspace` and build the project.

### Android Setup Instruction
